Creating backgammon game. Will try to make an AI that can will always play slightly better than me (Rolling EV move calculating, picking options right above my own moves) and give helpful hints when making obvious mistakes (risk exposure / low EV moves)

Will also try RL to help train a great bot. Can train against SOTA until matches, then further RL-Self play??
