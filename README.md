Creating backgammon game. Will try to make an AI that will always play slightly better than me (Rolling EV on moves, constantly picking an EV slightly better than myself) and give helpful hints when making obvious mistakes (risk exposure / low EV moves)

Will also try RL to help train a great bot. Can train against SOTA until matches, then further RL-Self play??
